<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  A 7th-class student and a blogger. I am a student of class 7 and am here to
  entertain all of you with my blogs. I will make sure that your mood is always
  fresh!
</p>

<p>
  I share my family incidents, school life, and spiritual life.â€‹Apart from
  blogging, my interest in coding is also growing because of my father. I study
  Chemistry, Physics, Bio, History, and Geography. When bored with all these, I
  grab my laptop and start coding in Java. It is a stress buster and a job
  provider too.

<p>You got to know a lot about me already. Go read my blogs! Bye...</p>
